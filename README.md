# Simple email sender in Python
This small script allows you to automatically send emails using most of the email service providers.

The key inputs that you need to know are: the SMTP server address and port, and obviously your account credentials.


**There are two steps to run this email sender:**
1. *In the email_credentials.py file enter yoru email and password*
2. *Make sure both .py files are in the same directory*
3. *Run the email_sender.py file*
